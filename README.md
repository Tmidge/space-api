# SpaceApi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.
It uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the table, paginator, and search.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## What I would do next

Translations, e2e tests, dark mode, more unit tests. 
Presskit is unreliable, some work some don't. Maybe test the link and fall back to the article?
Work on styles in general, how do we better say "This goes somewhere" when a launch has a press kit.
